# You Donut Get It
### Nerd Shit
This game was made using Godot version 4.2.1
This source code is for version 1.0.2 of the game.

One technical limitation the game has is that almost all of the collision shapes other than the donut had to be basic boxes due to how Godot's physics engine works with concave collision shapes work on RigidBodys. If you plan on playing around or modifying this game, I would recommend looking into the [Godot Jolt addon for Godot 4](https://github.com/godot-jolt/godot-jolt). It fixes the issues with weird collision shapes so you can just generate collision shapes from meshes for everything. However, it comes with the caveat that it won't export to web, which was why I didn't use it in this build of the game.

### Legal Tomfoolery
Alright so here's the deal, the code is under the MIT license (including all the .GD files). The MIT license will be in the source code files Some assets, including the fonts, control glyphs, and HDRs, were made by other people and are free to use. The music is under it's own license (put below this paragraph). Most of the models were made using basic meshes inside of Godot, however the few distinct models are free to use. All of the sound effects are also free to use. Most of the textures are also free to use with the main exception of the game's logo, which will get it's own section for an explaination.

The "Raccoon Formality" logo is also owned by "Raccoon Formality". Please do not use the "Raccoon Formality" logo in your modifications of the game.

TL:DR - just don't be an asshole and don't reupload my game for profit.
